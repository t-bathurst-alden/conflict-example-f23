Merge conflicts, DO not fear them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)

This is content that was definitely added through the GitHub interface. I am causing a merge conflict.

This sentence was added locally.

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.
